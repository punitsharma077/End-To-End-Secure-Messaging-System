# End-To-End-Secure-Messaging-System
This is an end to end messaging system where users can send messages/files to other users or to members of a group. 

Task is to design an end to end messaging system like WhatsApp with the below functional-
ities:

- Multiclient chat application that has a server component and 4 clients [atleast].
- The system should support the signup and sign in feature. [error message with wrong credentials].
- User can send message to other user [p2p message] [ SEND command] [<SEND><USERNAME>
    <MESSAGE>]
- Each user can join multiple chat rooms (groups) at a time.
- Each user can list all the groups. [LIST Command] [show all group and number of participants in
    each group]
- Each user can join a group [JOIN command]. If the group does not exist then the first create it then
    joins it.
- Each user can create a group [CREATE command].
- If one user sends a message to a group it should be sent to all members of that group.

#### 1)


- The message is encrypted using Tripple DES (3DES) or AES and the key will be Diffie–Hellman key type
    exchanged between clients.
- For each group make one key (random nonce).
- Message can be any type, for example, text, images, video, and audio.

Note: The one time Diffie–Hellman type key must be include a prive key (for instance roll nos.).
